# react-saga-example

This is a quick repo I put together while studying `React-Saga`. It is quite messy! I was just throwing together stuff to test what I was learning.

It also uses `Redux-Thunk` in the same store because I wanted to test the pros and cons of each approach and how they can be combined together.

Also, `Jest` tests for my fetch data saga.
